Attending The Workshop Through Adobe Connect
============================================

**This page contains information on how to first connect to Adobe
Connect, as well as tips for viewing content.**


Connecting for the first time
-----------------------------

### What you will need to connect

-   A computer (desktop/laptop) with internet connection, and web
    browser

-   Speakers, microphone/headset

-   **(Optional) **Webcam

You will not be able to connect to the lectures from a mobile device or
tablet. Although Adobe Connect has a mobile app, it will not support the
video feed we are using

### Software and Internet Setup

1.  Test your computer's ability to connect to Adobe by visiting the
following link: <http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm>. During the test, your browser settings and connection speed will be evaluated. We recommend that you use the [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox), and that you connect to the lectures using **wired** internet.
1.  If you do not have the Adobe Connect Add-in we ask that you download
    it:
    - Windows Add-in: [Download](file://localhost/wiki/download/attachments/43319319/ac_addin_win_976_291.zip%3Fversion=1&modificationDate=1464750038763&api=v2)
    - Mac Add-in: [Download](file://localhost/wiki/download/attachments/43319319/adobeconnect_9_addin_mac.zip%3Fversion=1&modificationDate=1464750440925&api=v2)

Using room features
-------------------

### Audio Setup

Normally, there should be no special setup to listen to the room audio.
When you connect ensure your speakers/headset are at a comfortable
volume, and that your audio is unmuted.

**To test and adjust your audio**

1.  Ensure your speaker icon is green

2.  If needed, check your audio by going to the **Meeting Menu &gt;
    Audio Setup Wizzard...** and follow the directions.

3.  If you continue to have issues you may also close the Adobe Connect
    window/ browser, or ask for help. 

### Viewing Video

When viewing the video, you can make the video window full screen by
pressing the 'arrows' icon at the upper-right of the video screen.

If your connection quality is poor, moving your mouse over the video
screen, move your mouse over the video screen to adjust the quality from
high to low

### Pods

Each of the windows in Adobe Connect are called pods. Some important
ones include:

-   Chat Pod - Chat with the room. Clicking on an attendee in the
    'Attendee' pod will start a private conversation in a tab in the
    Chat pod

-   Attendee Pod - See other attendees, start private conversations, see
    indications that you are speaking or have a 'raised hand'

-   Web Links Pod - Links to external websites

-   Files Pod - Download shared files

### Hand raising and feedback

Using the 'Hand Raise' icon, you can indicate you have question or
indicate several status options (see image). Use this icon again to
lower your hand or cancel a status.

### Camera and Microphone Setup

Typically, most participants choose to comment and ask questions using
the chat feature of the connect room. If you are asked to connect your
microphone or webcam, the appropriate icons must be **green**.

Viewing recorded content
------------------------

Typically, recorded content for lectures and presentations will be
available a few hours after the session ends. All recorded video will be
available on the LiveStream Site: the **LINK is posted on the Agenda
wiki page adjacent to the presentation time **

Screen Sharing
--------------

In order to share **your** screen, you **must** be viewing Adobe Connect
**from the Add-in** (See installation instructions in setup above). You
will not be able to share your screen if you are viewing Adobe Connect
that you launched directly from your Browser. Below are examples of
each:

**Adobe Connect Launched in Browser (unable to share screen)**

<embed src="media/image10.tmp" width="533" height="324" />

-   Launches in a web browser (URL is visible and ends in
    **?launcher=false**)

**Adobe Connect Launched in Add-in (able to share screen)**

<embed src="media/image11.tmp" width="533" height="350" />

-   Launches in its own window (no browser) and the window has its own
    Adobe Connect icon  
    <embed src="media/image12.tmp" width="66" height="66" />

**To Share Your screen:**

1.  Verify you are viewing the meeting in the add-in (as above)

2.  The host will present a 'pod' for sharing.

3.  Select **Share** **My Screen** and the select **Share** **My
    Screen**  
    <embed src="media/image13.tmp" width="624" height="416" />

4.  If necessary the host will also give instructions for allowing them
    to assume temporary control of your computer to work through
    technical support issues.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1.  Ensure pop-up blockers are disabled on your web browser

    1.  Firefox:
        <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pop-blocker-settings-exceptions-troubleshooting>

    2.  Safari:
        <http://www2.lbl.gov/ehs/training/webcourses/globalAssets/CourseRequirements/disablePopups/disablepopups.html#safari>

    3.  Windows Internet Explorer:
        <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Internet-Explorer-Pop-up-Blocker-frequently-asked-questions?1353591705>

    4.  Chrome:
        <https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chrome/m-WfaAOYRyA/lBrW0mIdE5gJ>

2.  Check your system volume/Mute for issues hearing content

3.  Ensure you passed the Adobe Connect setup test:
    <http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm>

In many cases, most problems are solved by closing connect (close the
add-in or browser **completely**), and restart the browser or connect
add-in. Restarting the computer may also help.
